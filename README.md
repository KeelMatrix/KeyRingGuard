# KeelMatrix.KeyRingGuard

`KeelMatrix.KeyRingGuard` verifies the Data Protection transitions an application depends on: restart continuity, replica sharing, intentional application and purpose isolation, and deterministic key-rotation continuity.

## Install

Install both packages in a test project:

```text
dotnet add package KeelMatrix.KeyRingGuard
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.Extensions
```

The Extensions package provides `DataProtectionProvider.Create`, while KeyRingGuard keeps provider integrations consumer-owned.

## Quick Start

First success:

```csharp
using KeelMatrix.KeyRingGuard;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection;

var keyStorePath = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), "keyringguard-" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString("N"));
Directory.CreateDirectory(keyStorePath);

try
{
    var factory = new KeyRingProviderFactory(
        _ => DataProtectionProvider.Create(
            new DirectoryInfo(keyStorePath),
            builder => builder.SetApplicationName("Sample.App")),
        TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

    var result = await KeyRingVerifier.VerifyAsync(
        KeyRingScenario.RestartContinuity,
        factory);

    if (!result.Succeeded)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException(result.Message);
    }

    Console.WriteLine("KeyRingGuard quick start: PASS");
}
finally
{
    Directory.Delete(keyStorePath, recursive: true);
}
```

## Supported runtime and platforms

The package targets `net8.0`. Windows is supported and tested here. Linux and macOS are supported by the package, but filesystem behavior on those platforms has not yet been verified in this repository. The repository uses the .NET SDK `10.0.401`, pinned in `global.json`, to build the package.

## Safety and privacy

KeyRingGuard uses synthetic, ephemeral canaries only, never key material. It has no telemetry dependency and does not delete or revoke keys. Verification is non-destructive to existing keys; opt-in rotation creates one new key in the caller's dedicated test store. Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Compatibility

The durable public API is pre-1.0. Breaking changes are possible before the first public release, and the shipping API baseline is enforced by public API analyzers.

## Scenarios and evidence

See the [installation and scenario guide](docs/usage.md) for replica sharing, isolation, rotation, provider factories, cleanup, and safe network-backed testing. See [what it proves](docs/what-it-proves.md) for the verification boundary.
